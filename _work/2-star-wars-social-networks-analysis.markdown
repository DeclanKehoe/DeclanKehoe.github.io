title: 'A Social Network Analysis of Star Wars'
description: 'I came up with the project to better understand exponential random graph modelling (ERGM), and used it to test hypothesis on the correlation between force sensitivity and character interaction in Star Wars'
---

### Overview

This was a fun project to test my learning in variety of disciplines related to social network analysis. Primarily it was a way to:

- Improve my knowledge or **R** and,
 
- Improve my ability to use R in **RStudio**

- Convert external data into format compatible with **statisitical analysis**

- Apply **descriptive statistics** to explain a novel dataset

- Use **ERGMs** to test **hypotheses** derived from the data

- Use **plots and graphs** to clcearly demonstrate the results of tests

### Reporting the results

Outside of nice graphs, there was actually evidence to support the hypotheses - but no spoilers. The report can be [viewed as a pdf](/assets/documents/star_wars_analysis_report.pdf) which has *all* the information, and is actually pretty short and readable. If I say so myself.

### Join in at home!

If you have [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) you can run this project yourself by [downloading the project files](/assets/files/star_wars_r_project.zip), unzipping them, opening 'Star Wars Data.RProj' and (making sure you install the required libraries) step through the code to follow the exact steps used to complete the report.
