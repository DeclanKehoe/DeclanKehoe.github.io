Welcome to my site. Hopefully it's what you were actually wanting to find.

If you want to skip to reading my CV, it's ready for [viewing or downloading](/assets/documents/declan_kehoe_cv.pdf).

Otherwise you can see out a collection of some of my other [works](/work), and weep. I know I do.

You could also [read the about me](/about), to learn a little... about me.

If none of that is good, here's a picture of my dog Bilbo as a consolation prize
